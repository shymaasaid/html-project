The Internet of Things, as a concept, wasnâ€™t officially named until 1999. 
One of the first examples of an Internet of Things is from the early 1980s, 
and was a Coca Cola machine, located at the Carnegie Melon University. 
Local programmers would connect by Internet to the refrigerated appliance, 
and check to see if there was a drink available, and if it was cold, before making the trip.
By the year 2013, the Internet of Things had evolved into to a system using multiple technologies, 
ranging from the Internet to wireless communication and from micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) to embedded systems. 
The traditional fields of automation (including the automation of buildings and homes), 
wireless sensor networks, GPS, control systems, and others, all support the IoT.

Kevin Ashton, the Executive Director of Auto-ID Labs at MIT, 
was the first to describe the Internet of Things, while making a presentation for Procter & Gamble.
